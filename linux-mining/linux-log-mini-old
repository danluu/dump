    [PATCH] x86_64 genapic update
    
    x86_64 genapic mechanism should be aware of machines that use physical APIC
    mode regardless of how many clusters/processors are detected.
    
    ACPI 3.0 FADT makes this determination very simple by providing a feature
    flag "force_apic_physical_destination_mode" to state whether the machine
    unconditionally uses physical APIC mode.
    
    Unisys' next generation x86_64 ES7000 will need to utilize this FADT
    feature flag in order to boot the x86_64 kernel in the correct APIC mode.
    This patch has been tested on both x86_64 commodity and ES7000 boxes.

    Only display physical id/siblings when there are siblings or dual core.
    
    In 2.6.11 I accidentially broke it and it was always displaying these
    fields But for compatibility to all these /proc parsers around it is better
    to do it in the old way again.

    [PATCH] i386: Use loaddebug macro consistently
    
    This moves the macro loaddebug from asm-i386/suspend.h to
    asm-i386/processor.h, which is the place that makes sense for it to be
    defined, removes the extra copy of the same macro in
    arch/i386/kernel/process.c, and makes arch/i386/kernel/signal.c use the
    macro in place of its expansion.
    
    This is a purely cosmetic cleanup for the normal i386 kernel.  However, it
    is handy for Xen to be able to just redefine the loaddebug macro once
    instead of also changing the signal.c code.

    [PATCH] ppc64: no prefetch for NULL pointers
    
    For prefetches of NULL (as when walking a short linked list), PPC64 will in
    some cases take a performance hit.  The hardware needs to do the TLB walk,
    and said walk will always miss, which means (up to) two L2 misses as
    penalty.  This seems to hurt overall performance, so for NULL pointers skip
    the prefetch alltogether.

    [PATCH] ppc64: remove -fno-omit-frame-pointer
    
    During some code inspection using gcc 4.0 I noticed a stack frame was being
    created for a number of functions that didnt require it.  For example:
    
    c0000000000df944 <._spin_unlock>:
    c0000000000df944:       fb e1 ff f0     std     r31,-16(r1)
    c0000000000df948:       f8 21 ff c1     stdu    r1,-64(r1)
    c0000000000df94c:       7c 3f 0b 78     mr      r31,r1
    c0000000000df950:       7c 20 04 ac     lwsync
    c0000000000df954:       e8 21 00 00     ld      r1,0(r1)
    c0000000000df958:       38 00 00 00     li      r0,0
    c0000000000df95c:       90 03 00 00     stw     r0,0(r3)
    c0000000000df960:       eb e1 ff f0     ld      r31,-16(r1)
    c0000000000df964:       4e 80 00 20     blr
    
    It turns out we are adding -fno-omit-frame-pointer to ppc64 which is
    causing the above behaviour.  Removing that flag results in much better
    code:
    
    c0000000000d5b30 <._spin_unlock>:
    c0000000000d5b30:       7c 20 04 ac     lwsync
    c0000000000d5b34:       38 00 00 00     li      r0,0
    c0000000000d5b38:       90 03 00 00     stw     r0,0(r3)
    c0000000000d5b3c:       4e 80 00 20     blr
    
    We dont require a frame pointer to debug on ppc64, so remove it.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Detect altivec via firmware on unknown CPUs
    
    This patch adds detection of the Altivec capability of the CPU via the
    firmware in addition to the cpu table.  This allows newer CPUs that aren't
    in the table to still have working altivec support in the kernel.
    
    It also fixes a problem where if a CPU isn't recognized as having altivec
    features, and takes an altivec unavailable exception due to userland
    issuing altivec instructions, the kernel would happily enable it and
    context switch the registers ...  but not all of them (it would basically
    forget vrsave).  With this patch, the kernel will refuse to enable altivec
    when the feature isn't detected for the CPU (SIGILL).

    [PATCH] ppc64: Improve mapping of vDSO
    
    This patch reworks the way the ppc64 is mapped in user memory by the kernel
    to make it more robust against possible collisions with executable
    segments.  Instead of just whacking a VMA at 1Mb, I now use
    get_unmapped_area() with a hint, and I moved the mapping of the vDSO to
    after the mapping of the various ELF segments and of the interpreter, so
    that conflicts get caught properly (it still has to be before
    create_elf_tables since the later will fill the AT_SYSINFO_EHDR with the
    proper address).
    
    While I was at it, I also changed the 32 and 64 bits vDSO's to link at
    their "natural" address of 1Mb instead of 0.  This is the address where
    they are normally mapped in absence of conflict.  By doing so, it should be
    possible to properly prelink one it's been verified to work on glibc.

    provide the flag they want here.  This allows things like framebuffers to
    explicitely request a non-cacheable and non-guarded mapping which is more
    efficient for that type of memory without side effects.  The patch also
    fixes all current callers to add _PAGE_GUARDED except btext, which is fine
    without it.

    [PATCH] ppc64: very basic desktop g5 sound support
    
    This patch hacks the current PowerMac Alsa driver to add some basic support
    of analog sound output to some desktop G5s.  It has severe limitations
    though:
    
     - Only 44100Khz 16 bits
     - Only work on G5 models using a TAS3004 analog code, that is early
       single CPU desktops and all dual CPU desktops at this date, but none
       of the more recent ones like iMac G5.
     - It does analog only, no digital/SPDIF support at all, no native
       AC3 support
    
    Better support would require a complete rewrite of the driver (which I am
    working on, but don't hold your breath), to properly support the diversity
    of apple sound HW setup, including dual codecs, several i2s busses, all the
    new codecs used in the new machines, proper clock switching with digital,
    etc etc etc...
    
    This patch applies on top of the other PowerMac sound patches I posted in
    the past couple of days (new powerbook support and sleep fixes).
    
    Note: This is a FAQ entry for PowerMac sound support with TI codecs: They
    have a feature called "DRC" which is automatically enabled for the internal
    speaker (at least when auto mute control is enabled) which will cause your
    sound to fade out to nothing after half a second of playback if you don't
    set a proper "DRC Range" in the mixer.  So if you have a problem like that,
    check alsamixer and raise your DRC Range to something reasonable.
    
    Note2: This patch will also add auto-mute of the speaker when line-out jack
    is used on some earlier desktop G4s (and on the G5) in addition to the
    headphone jack.  If that behaviour isn't what you want, just disable
    auto-muting and use the manual mute controls in alsamixer.

    amplifiers and does an analog shutdown of the codec.  That might improve
    power consumption during sleep on a number of machines.

    [PATCH] pmac: sound support for latest laptops
    
    This patch hacks the current Alsa snd-powermac driver to add support for
    recent machine models with the tas3004 chip, that is basically new laptop
    models.  The Mac Mini is _NOT_ yet supported by this patch (soon soon ...).
     The G5s (iMac or Desktop) will need the rewritten sound driver on which
    I'm working on (I _might_ get a hack for analog only on some G5s on the
    current driver, but no promise).

    [PATCH] ppc32: Fix a problem with NTP on !(chrp||gemini)
    
    The following problem was found by Giovambattista Pulcini
    <gpulcini@swintel.it>, who also provided a partial patch, and this has been
    verified by our time guru Gabriel Paubert <paubert@iram.es>.
    
    The problem is that in do_settimeofday() we always set time_state to
    TIME_ERROR and except on two platforms, never re-set it.  This meant that
    ntp_gettime() and ntp_adjtime() always returned TIME_ERROR, incorrectly.
    Based on Gabriel's analysis, time_state is used for leap-second processing,
    and ppc shouldn't be mucking with it.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Support 36-bit physical addressing on e500
    
    To add support for 36-bit physical addressing on e500 the following changes
    have been made.  The changes are generalized to support any physical address
    size larger than 32-bits:
    
    * Allow FSL Book-E parts to use a 64-bit PTE, it is 44-bits of pfn, 20-bits
      of flags.
    
    * Introduced new CPU feature (CPU_FTR_BIG_PHYS) to allow runtime handling of
      updating hardware register (SPRN_MAS7) which holds the upper 32-bits of
      physical address that will be written into the TLB.  This is useful since
      not all e500 cores support 36-bit physical addressing.
    
    * Currently have a pass through implementation of fixup_bigphys_addr
    
    * Moved _PAGE_DIRTY in the 64-bit PTE case to free room for three additional
      storage attributes that may exist in future FSL Book-E cores and updated
      fault handler to copy these bits into the hardware TLBs.

    Allow the pfn to be offset by more than just PAGE_SHIFT in the pte.  Today,
    PAGE_SHIFT tends to allow us to have 12-bits of flags in the pte.  In the

    offsetting the pfn even further.

    [PATCH] ppc32: make usage of CONFIG_PTE_64BIT & CONFIG_PHYS_64BIT consistent
    
    CONFIG_PTE_64BIT & CONFIG_PHYS_64BIT are not currently consistently used in
    the code base.  Fixed up the usage such that CONFIG_PTE_64BIT is used when we
    have a 64-bit PTE regardless of physical address width.  CONFIG_PHYS_64BIT is
    used if the physical address width is larger than 32-bits, regardless of PTE
    size.
    
    These changes required a few sub-arch specific ifdef's to be fixed and the
    introduction of a physical address format string.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Fix pte_update for 64-bit PTEs
    
    While the existing pte_update code handled atomically modifying a 64-bit PTE,
    it did not return all 64-bits of the PTE before it was modified.  This causes
    problems in some places that expect the full PTE to be returned, like
    ptep_get_and_clear().
    
    Created a new pte_update function that is conditional on CONFIG_PTE_64BIT.  It
    atomically reads the low PTE word which all PTE flags are required to be in
    and returns a premodified full 64-bit PTE.
    
    Since we now have an explicit 64-bit PTE version of pte_update we can also
    remove the hack that existed to get the low PTE word regardless of size.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Fix AGP and sleep again
    
    My previous patch that added sleep support for uninorth-agp and some AGP
    "off" stuff in radeonfb and aty128fb is breaking some configs.  More
    specifically, it has problems with rage128 setups since the DRI code for
    these in X doesn't properly re-enable AGP on wakeup or console switch
    (unlike the radeon DRM).
    
    This patch fixes the problem for pmac once for all by using a different
    approach.  The AGP driver "registers" special suspend/resume callbacks with
    some arch code that the fbdev's can later on call to suspend and resume
    AGP, making sure it's resumed back in the same state it was when suspended.
     This is platform specific for now.  It would be too complicated to try to
    do a generic implementation of this at this point due to all sort of weird
    things going on with AGP on other architectures.  We'll re-work that whole
    problem cleanly once we finally merge fbdev's and DRI.
    
    In the meantime, please apply this patch which brings back some r128 based
    laptops into working condition as far as system sleep is concerned.

    [PATCH] ppc32: ppc4xx_pic - add acknowledge when enabling level-sensitive IRQ
    
    This patch adds interrupt acknowledge to the PPC4xx PIC enable_irq
    implementation for level-sensitive IRQ sources.  This helps in cases when
    enable/disable_irq is used in interrupt handlers for hardware, which
    requires IRQ acknowledge to be issued from non-interrupt context (e.g.
    when actual ACK in device needs an I2C transaction).  For such strange
    hardware, interrupt handler disables IRQ and defers actual ACK to some
    other context.  When this happens, IRQ is enabled again.  For
    level-sensitive sources we get spurious triggering right after IRQ is
    enabled.  This patch fixes this.

    [PATCH] Fix linux/atalk.h header
    
    This recently got changed to include a lot of kernel internal stuff in the
    non-__KERNEL__ area of the header, which isn't so kosher and breaks libc
    builds.
    
    The fix is pretty simple.

    [PATCH] meminfo: add Cached underflow check
    
    Working on some code lately I've been getting huge values for "Cached".
    The cause is that get_page_cache_size() is an approximate value, and for a
    sufficiently small returned value of get_page_cache_size() the value
    underflows.

    [PATCH] filemap_getpage can block when MAP_NONBLOCK specified
    
    We will return NULL from filemap_getpage when a page does not exist in the
    page cache and MAP_NONBLOCK is specified, here:
    
    	page = find_get_page(mapping, pgoff);
    	if (!page) {
    		if (nonblock)
    			return NULL;
    		goto no_cached_page;
    	}
    
    But we forget to do so when the page in the cache is not uptodate.  The
    following could result in a blocking call:
    
    	/*
    	 * Ok, found a page in the page cache, now we need to check
    	 * that it's up-to-date.
    	 */
    	if (!PageUptodate(page))
    		goto page_not_uptodate;

    This was unexported by Arjan because we have no current users.
    
    However, during a conversion from tasklets to workqueues of the parisc led
    functions, we ran across a case where this was needed.  In particular, the
    open coded equivalent of cancel_rearming_delayed_workqueue was implemented
    incorrectly, which is, I think, all the evidence necessary that this is a
    useful API.

    ARM wasn't raising a SIGBUS with a siginfo structure.  Fix
    __do_user_fault() to allow us to use it for SIGBUS conditions, and arrange
    for the sigbus path to use this.
    
    We need to prevent the siginfo code being called if we do not have a user
    space context to call it, so consolidate the "user_mode()" tests.

    Linux-2.6.12-rc2
    
    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3.2GB when imported into git - space that would just make the early
    git days unnecessarily complicated, when we don't have a lot of good
    infrastructure for it.
    
    Let it rip!
